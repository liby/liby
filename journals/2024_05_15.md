					- 主语 + has/have + been + being + 过去分词（done）
				- 被动语态使用 **has/have been being + 过去分词**。
			- **过去完成时**：
				- 主动语态：**She had cleaned the house.**
				- 被动语态：**The house had been cleaned (by her).**
				- 使用 **been** 来表示完成时态。
			- **将来时**：
				- 主动语态：**She will clean the house.**
				- 被动语态：**The house will be cleaned (by her).**
				- 保留 **be** 动词。
			- **将来完成时**：
				- 主动语态：**She will have cleaned the house.**
				- 被动语态：**The house will have been cleaned (by her).**
				- 使用 **been** 来表示完成时态。
